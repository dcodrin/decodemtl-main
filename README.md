# DecodeMTL Main Website (React client and Node server)

This is still a work in progress. 

## Getting started

Clone or download the repo then:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Client will run locally on port `3000`
Server will run on port `3100`

## See the site live [_DecodeMTL_](https://decode-main.herokuapp.com/) on heroku. 
```
Apps running on heroku's free plan are not kept active as such it might take some 10 seconds for the site to load.
This does not represent the performance of the site.
