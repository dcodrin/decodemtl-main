        question: 'Why should I take this course?',
        answer: 'JavaScript is the programming language of the Web browser, and has spread to other domains, from robotics to servers. Its ubiquity, necessity for Web developers, and ease of deployment - make JavaScript a must-learn language. Not only do you have to know it to be a modern software developer, but JavaScript is also immediately useful in the hands of a beginner, making it a great first programming language.'
