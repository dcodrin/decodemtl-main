            <h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>

            <h2>How Does the Company Collect Your Personal Information?</h2>
            <p>
                We collect your personal information at the time you become a new customer, client, supplier, employee
                or
                contractor of the Company and thereafter when we communicate with you. For example, we collect your
                personal information through:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>our sales and supply agreements with you</li>
                <li>your discussions with our employees and contractors</li>
                <li>your visits to our website and/or intranet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Employees/contractors are responsible for ensuring that changes to their personal information
                (i.e. address, telephone number, social insurance number, banking information for the purpose of direct
                deposit, etc.) are communicated to us.</p>

            <h2>How Does the Company Protect Personal Information?</h2>
            <p>Safeguards, security systems and processes are in place to protect your
                information against unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification, whether on-site or
                off-site.</p>
            <p>Human resource files as well as information regarding payroll and benefits
                coverage is accessible to those Company individuals who have been designated with such authority and
                only to the extent necessary to accomplish the objectives we’ve described above, or to the Company’s
                relevant benefits and/or payroll providers. All personal employee/contractor information maintained
                within the Company is centrally located and is maintained secure and confidential. All personal
                information provided to the Company’s benefits and/or payroll providers is disclosed only upon
                assurances
                that those providers maintain similar standards of personal information protection.</p>

            <h2>How Long Will the Company Retain Your Information?</h2>
            <p>We retain your information for only so long as is necessary for the purposes
                for which it has been collected. Your personal information will be destroyed once it is no longer needed
                by us and once all requirements at law have been met.</p>

            <h2>Have You Consented?</h2>
            <p>There are some instances where we may need to disclose personal information
                to a third party service provider. Whenever we engage a third party service provider, we confirm that
                its
                privacy and security standards meet our requirements. In the event that a third party service provider
                is
                located outside of Canada, the government, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that
                jurisdiction may be able to obtain disclosure of your personal information through the laws of that
                jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>By submitting your personal information to us, you have consented to our use
                and disclosure of the personal information for the purposes as outlined in this policy. If we wish to
                use or disclose your personal information other than as described in this policy, we will obtain your
                express consent before doing so.</p>
            <p>If you prefer that we not use or disclose your personal information for any
                of these purposes, you may notify us in writing at any time. If you do not notify us, we will consider
                you to have consented to our continued use and disclosure of your personal information. A notification
                that we not use or disclose your personal information for certain purposes may affect our ability to
                provide you with products and/or services.</p>
            <p>Please note that from time to time, we may be compelled to release personal
                information as required or permitted by law.</p>

            <h2>How Can You Access Your Personal Information?</h2>
            <p>Your personal information, hard copy or electronic, is accessible to you.
                However please note that if your information is combined with information of others
                (such as payroll spreadsheets), you will not be granted access to such information unless we are
                able to segment your personal information. If your request for personal information entails a
                significant
                cost due to time, resources or copying, there may be a charge.</p>
