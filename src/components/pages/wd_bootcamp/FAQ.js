        question: 'What are the technical qualifications?',
        answer: 'Most of our students have dabbled in code, either in school, professionally, or out of curiosity. You should have a high-level knowledge of the different types of programming and languages that exist, and have at the very least tinkered with sites like CodeSchool or Codecademy. Our admissions process and pre-course work are designed to get you up to speed and ready for the bootcamp, so you don\'t need to be a coding ninja to apply. If you\'re not sure if you are ready to apply, contact us and we will point you in the right direction.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What are the non technical qualifications?',
        answer: 'You need passion, and lots of it! Passion is the recurring characteristic we find in all successful students. If you love what you do, you will ultimately be successful.'

    {
        question: 'Will I build an App in this course?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! In the last two weeks of the course, you will be placed in a team and tasked to build a web based application from the ground up. This capstone project will then be presented to a large audience on the last day of the course. This Demo Day event will serve as a way to network with potential employers who will be in the room watching your presentation.'

    {
        question: 'When should I apply to an upcoming cohort?',
        answer: 'As soon as you know you are ready to commit, you should apply. At the very latest, we suggest two months before the course start date. This gives you time to get through admissions and adequately prepare for the course.'
