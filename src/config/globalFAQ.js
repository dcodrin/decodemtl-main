        question: 'What are the technical qualifications?',
        answer: 'Most of our students have dabbled in code, either in school, professionally, or out of curiosity.

Our admissions process and pre-course work are designed to get you up to speed and ready for the bootcamp, so you don\'t need to be a coding ninja to apply. If you\'re not sure if you are ready to apply, contact us and we will point you in the right direction.',
